Teodora:
This project analyzes SU data in Denmark from the year 2000 and onward. It combines information from three Excel files, covering total stipends, number of recipients, and support-year equivalents.
The script cleans and merges the data, calculates the average SU amount per student each year, and visualizes the results in a line chart. The final chart shows how SU support has changed over time.
